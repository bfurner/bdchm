URI: https://w3id.org/nhlbidatastage/bdchm Name: bdchm Classes Class Description Entity Any resource that has its own identifier Organization A grouping of people or organizations with a common purpose such as a data coordinating center, an university, or an institute within a university. Participant A Participant is the entity of interest in a research study, typically a human being or an animal, but can also be a device, group of humans or animals, or a tissue sample. Human research subjects are usually not traceable to a particular person to protect the subject\u2019s privacy. Person Demographics and other administrative information about an individual or animal receiving care or other health-related services. Questionnaire A Questionnaire is an organized collection of questions intended to solicit information from patients, providers or other individuals involved in the healthcare domain. They may be simple flat lists of questions or can be hierarchically organized in groups and sub-groups, each containing questions. The Questionnaire defines the questions to be asked, how they are ordered and grouped, any intervening instructional text and what the constraints are on the allowed answers. The results of a Questionnaire can be communicated using the QuestionnaireResponse. (FHIR) QuestionnaireItem QuestionnaireItem defines a question or section within the Questionnaire QuestionnaireResponse QuestionnaireResponse provides a complete or partial list of answers to a set of questions filled when responding to a questionnaire. (FHIR) ResearchStudy A process where a researcher or organization plans and then executes a series of steps intended to increase the field of healthcare-related knowledge. This includes studies of safety, efficacy, comparative effectiveness and other information about medications, devices, therapies and other interventional and investigative techniques. A ResearchStudy involves the gathering of information about human or animal subjects. TimePoint A structured representation of a single point in time that allows direct/explicit declaration as a dateTime, specification in terms of offset from a defined index, or description of an event type as a proxy for the time point when it occurred. Visit Events where Persons engage with the healthcare system for a duration of time. They are often also called \u201cEncounters\u201d. Visits are defined by a configuration of circumstances under which they occur, such as (i) whether the patient comes to a healthcare institution, the other way around, or the interaction is remote, (ii) whether and what kind of trained medical staff is delivering the service during the Visit, and (iii) whether the Visit is transient or for a longer period involving a stay in bed. (OMOP) Identifier An Identifier is associated with a unique object or entity within a given system.

They are often also called \u201cEncounters\u201d. Visits are defined by a configuration of circumstances under which they occur, such as (i) whether the patient comes to a healthcare institution, the other way around, or the interaction is remote, (ii) whether and what kind of trained medical staff is delivering the service during the Visit, and (iii) whether the Visit is transient or for a longer period involving a stay in bed.

The simple value of this attribute stands for an identifier of this data object within the system, it can be used as a reference from other objects within the same system (i.e. primary and foreign keys), and it should be unique per type of object. The same data object copied to a different system will likely have a different \"id\" in the new system since \"id\" values are system specific and do not represent persistent business identifiers. Business identifiers are assigned outside the information system and are captured in the \"identifier\" field. The \"id\" field is more likely to be a serially or randomly generated value that is assigned to the data object as it is created in a system. from_schema: https://w3id.org/nhlbidatastage/bdchm rank: 1000 slot_uri: schema:identifier identifier: true alias: id owner: Visit domain_of: - Entity range: uriorcurie required: true","title":"Induced"},{"location":"VisitCategoryEnum/","text":"Enum: VisitCategoryEnum URI: VisitCategoryEnum Permissible Values Value Meaning Description INPATIENT OMOP:9201 Person visiting hospital, at a care stie, in bed, for duration of more than o...
