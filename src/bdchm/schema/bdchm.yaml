    comments:
    - At the core of an Observation is a flexible key-value pair (or a structured
      collection of key-value pairs), where a 'key' field defines the type of observation
      made, and the 'value' field describes the value or outcome of the observation.
      The fact that the type of observation captured is defined in the data allow
      Observation to convey a broad range of observation data.

    description: A structured object that describes a single data item about the quantity
      of an entity, as generated through a point-in-time observation or measurement.
    comments:
    - At the core of an Observation is a flexible key-value pair (or a structured
      collection of key-value pairs), where a 'key' field defines the type of observation
      made, and the 'value' field describes the value or outcome of the observation.
      The fact that the type of observation captured is defined in the data allow
      Observation to convey a broad range of observation data.

    comments:
    - QuantityMeasure' may be implemented as an Observation-like object that will
      let us capture any type of measure of the amount of some substance (e.g. weight,
      volume, maybe even concentration?), with distinct timestamps and methods associated.  It
      could be implemented as a "simple" observation (one measurement per instance,
      where the 'code' fields is bound to a value set describing the different types
      of quantity measures allowed -  e.g. 'weight', 'volume', 'concentration'),  or
      as "composite" observation (multiple measurements possible in a single instance,
      each captured as a component defined to hold a specific type of quantity measure
      - e.g.  'weight', 'volume', 'concentration').  The number of different quantity
      measures we anticipate needed to support, and the potential for data sparseness,
      are factors that determine whether a simple or composite Observation would be
      most appropriate.
