The same data object copied to a different system will likely have a different "id" in the new system since "id" values are system specific and do not represent persistent business identifiers. Business identifiers are assigned outside the information system and are captured in the "identifier" field. The "id" field is more likely to be a serially or randomly generated value that is assigned to the data object as it is created in a system.

Also, since these identifiers are created outside the information system through a specific business process, the Identifier type has additional attributes to capture this additional metadata so the actual identifier values are qualified by the context that created those values. This additional context allows "identifier" instances to be transmitted as business data across systems while still being able to trace them back to the system of origin.
